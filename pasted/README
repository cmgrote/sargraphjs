Currently leveraging on xinetd to receive stream of text
the file paste_service is the xinetd configuration of the paste.sh listener

To be done:
This will be a service that will receive a stream of text 
parse it and convert it into a consumable data source

I will begin by processing the output of sadf and then I will make it process other types of data
such as logs.
